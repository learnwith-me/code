You need to create two sets
of radio buttons:

The first set should exclusively
offer selections from the games
array,and the second set should
enable selection of days from the
array.Both sets must be dynamically
generated.

const games = ["Chess", "Football", "Basketball", "Tennis"];
const days = ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday"];
